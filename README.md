# Brain-tumor-detection

Brain tumor is the growth of abnormal cells in brain some of which may leads to cancer. The usual method to detect brain tumor is Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) scans.
From the MRI images information about the abnormal tissue growth in the brain is identified.


There are two main categories of brain tumor, they are non-cancerous (benign) brain tumor and cancerous(malignant) brain tumor. Survival rate of a tumor prone patient is difficult to predict because brain tumor is uncommon and are different types.

 
When these algorithms are applied on the MRI images the prediction of brain tumor is done very fast and a higher accuracy helps in providing the treatment to the patients. These prediction also helps the radiologist in making quick decisions.


In this work, automatic brain tumor detection is proposed by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classification.


Other Detail:

This project has been developed by Abhiroop Sarkar & Prateek Dutta for the purpose of institutional project. Further Model Deployement is on process.

Dataset can be shared on requirement basis for educational purpose only. Candidate with requirement can mail a by mentioning the designation and current role with proper identity card in attachment.
